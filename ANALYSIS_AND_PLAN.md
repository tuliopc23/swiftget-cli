# SwiftGet CLI Analysis and Development Plan

## Current Status: ✅ MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED

SwiftGet has been successfully transformed from a basic 50-line CLI script into a comprehensive, professional-grade download manager that compiles and runs successfully on Linux with Swift 6.1.

## What We've Accomplished

### ✅ Complete Architecture Overhaul
- **Before**: Basic CLI with only help/version commands
- **After**: Full-featured download manager with modular architecture

### ✅ Core Features Implemented
1. **HTTP/HTTPS Downloads** - Full support with progress bars
2. **Resume Downloads** - Partial download continuation with Range headers
3. **Progress Reporting** - Real-time progress bars with speed/ETA
4. **Checksum Verification** - MD5, SHA1, SHA256 support
5. **Configuration Management** - Persistent config file system
6. **Proxy Support** - HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS proxy configuration
7. **Custom Headers** - User-Agent and custom HTTP headers
8. **Archive Extraction** - Basic ZIP extraction support
9. **Cross-platform** - Linux and macOS compatibility

### ✅ Professional CLI Interface
- Comprehensive argument parsing with ArgumentParser
- Subcommands: `download` (default) and `config`
- Rich help system with detailed options
- Proper error handling and logging

### ✅ Technical Excellence
- **Swift 6.1 Compatible** - Uses modern Swift concurrency (async/await)
- **Actor-based Architecture** - Thread-safe download management
- **Modular Design** - 6 core modules for maintainability
- **Cross-platform** - Works on Linux and macOS
- **Dependency Management** - Uses Swift Package Manager

### 🚧 Advanced Features To Implement

#### Phase 1: Multi-Connection Downloads
- **Segmented Downloads**: Split files into chunks for parallel download
- **Connection Pooling**: Multiple simultaneous connections per file
- **Bandwidth Optimization**: Intelligent chunk size adjustment

#### Phase 2: Protocol Extensions
- **FTP/SFTP Support**: File transfer protocols
- **BitTorrent Support**: P2P downloads
- **Metalink Support**: Multi-source downloads

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- **Batch Processing**: Queue management and scheduling
- **Rate Limiting**: Bandwidth throttling
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff and error recovery
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture

**Goal**: Support FTP, SFTP, and basic BitTorrent

**Tasks**:
1. Add FTP protocol handler
2. Implement SFTP with SSH keys
3. Basic BitTorrent client integration
4. Metalink parser and multi-source downloads

**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 weeks

### 🎯 Phase 3: Advanced Features (Priority: Medium)
**Goal**: Enterprise-grade download management

**Tasks**:
1. Queue management system
2. Scheduling and automation
3. Advanced retry mechanisms
4. Plugin architecture
5. Web UI (optional)

**Estimated Effort**: 6-8 weeks
